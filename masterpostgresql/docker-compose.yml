# A Docker Compose must always start with the version tag.
# We use '3' because it's the last version.
version: '3'

# You should know that Docker Compose works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:
  # The name of our service is "database"
  # but you can use the name of your choice.
  # Note: This may change the commands you are going to use a little bit.
  database:
    # Official Postgres image from DockerHub (we use the last version)
    image: 'postgres:latest'

    # By default, a Postgres database is running on the 5432 port.
    # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the port with our computer's port.
    # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

    # We use the environment keyword to set environment variables.
    env_file:
      - .env # We use the .env file to store our environment variables.

    # We use the volumes keyword to share files between our computer and the container.
    # The syntax is [path to the file on our computer]:[path to the file in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change the path on your computer,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are sharing files between your computer and the container.
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # We share the data folder with the container.
