# Distributed Systems
Course project for LUT's Distributed Systems -course.

## Project Introduction
The idea of this project was to create a word-guessing CLI game, where players could try to explain and guess randomized Finnish words.

## Project Architecture

This system consists of two main components: server services and client applications.

Server side is divided into three main services: 

1. Master database 
2. Master node 
3. Worker node

## How to use?

1. **Setup Master Database:**
 
 Please refer to README in `./master/database/`

2. **Setup Master Node:**

3. **Setup Worker Node:**

 python3 ./main.py
 ```
